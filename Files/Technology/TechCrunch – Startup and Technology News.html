It\u2019s like a more adorable version of that one scene from <em>The Shining<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>The difference is noticeable, but it\u2019s not like night and day or anything.

The different quality could account for the perceived difference between the two.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s very nice outside today, but we\u2019re in here recording keyboard sounds.

The study collected information in two stages; first for several weeks before the renovation and the second for several weeks after.<\/p>\n<p>While the concept behind open office spaces is to drive informal interaction and collaboration among employees, the study found that for both groups of employees monitored (52 for one company and 100 for the other company) face-to-face interactions dropped, the number of emails sent increased between 20 and 50 percent and company executives reported a qualitative drop in productivity.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[Organizations] transform their office architectures into open spaces with the intention of creating more [face-to-face] interaction and thus a more vibrant work environment,&#8221; the study&#8217;s authors, Ethan Bernstein and Stephen Turban, wrote. &#8220;[But] what they often get\u2014as captured by a steady stream of news articles professing the death of the open office is an open expanse of proximal employees choosing to isolate themselves as best they can (e.g. by wearing large headphones) while appearing to be as busy as possible (since everyone can see them).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While this study <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2011\/07\/who-moved-my-cube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is far from the first to point fingers<\/a> at open office space designs, the researchers claim this is the first study of its kind to collect qualitative data on this shift in working environment instead of relying primarily on employee surveys.<\/p>\n<p>From their results, the researchers provide three cautionary tales:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open office spaces don&#8217;t actually promote interaction. Instead, they cause employees to seek privacy wherever they can find it.<\/li>\n<li>These open spaces might spell bad news for collective company intelligence or, in other words, an overstimulating office space creates a decrease in organizational productivity.<\/li>\n<li>Not all channels of interaction will be effected equally in an open layout change. While the number of emails sent in the study did increase, the study found that the richness of this interaction was not equal to that lost in face-to-face interactions.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Seems like it might be time to (first, find a quiet room) and go back to the drawing board with the open office design.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;re endlessly distracted by your co-workers in the gaping open office space you all share, you&#8217;re not alone.

Walmart, the world&#8217;s biggest retailer when counting physical stores, has yet to really hit the right note in e-commerce and comes in behind Apple with 3.7 percent of online sales in the US.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical CToWUd a6T\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/ci4.googleusercontent.com\/proxy\/-PgHRaD0RNJP5Hhc5s3ahdXC9QvNKKslptI01GPA-NGOw4sezOr_irA70Eq8twzHdkDkuoXWxb7iF_IM4chlz6WyOsRdoSmIn-7giMfCCg5V0YM4M5uYX0I3uRL-McaPCeKkEun9WM5y6Q5-jGR1oj7bxPGvtrdSTjQES17D0L2GgWVqxGujhcvqcwIiKP8lvROjpn4kosty7oIKSDibR_emQsc22rDqo9PhojqcIFdBE3A2A0FHwofEi4cC=s0-d-e1-ft#http:\/\/sentpressrelease.com\/pressrelease\/image\/258076\/ZU1hcmtldGVyX1RvcF8xMF9VU19Db21wYW5pZXNfUmFua2VkX2J5X1JldGFpbF9FY29tbWVyY2VfU2FsZXNfU2hhcmVfMjAxOF8yMzk0NDcuanBn\" width=\"450\" height=\"617\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The figures &#8212; which eMarketer says are estimates &#8220;based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from research firms, government agencies, media firms and public companies, plus interviews with top executives at publishers, ad buyers and agencies&#8221; &#8212; are also remarkable not because of their size, but because of Amazon&#8217;s pace has not slowed down. Its sales are up 29.2 percent versus a year ago, when it commanded 43 percent of all e-commerce retail sales.<\/p>\n<p>The rocket ship for Amazon&#8217;s growth at the moment is its Marketplace &#8212; the platform where Amazon allows third-party sellers to use its retail and (if they choose) logistics infrastructure to sell and deliver items to Amazon shoppers. It&#8217;s currently accounting for 68 percent of all retail sales, working out to nearly $176 billion, versus 32 percent for Amazon&#8217;s direct sales, and eMarketer projects that by the end of this year, Marketplace&#8217;s share will be more than double that of Amazon&#8217;s own sales (it&#8217;s already about double).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that so many other online commerce businesses are chasing the marketplace model, which essentially creates transactions on two fronts for the platform operator, thereby improving margins that might be cut by not selling items directly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe continued growth of Amazon\u2019s Marketplace makes sense on a number of levels,\u201d eMarketer principal analyst Andrew Lipsman notes in the eMarketer report. \u201cMore buyers transacting more often on Amazon will naturally attract third-party sellers. But because third-party transactions are also more profitable, Amazon has every incentive to make the process as seamless as possible for those selling on the platform.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In terms of popular categories, consumer electronics and tech continue to be the leading product category: eMarketer projects sales of $65.82 billion, around one-fourth of all turnover.\u00a0Second will be apparel and accessories, which will pull in $39.88 billion of sales.\u00a0Third in 2018 are health, personal care and beauty with $16 billion. Fourth is food and beverage at a distant $4.75 billion.<\/p>\n<p>All of these are already up by 38 percent or more over a year ago (see the full table below), but what&#8217;s perhaps most notable is how Amazon has been investing in being a direct player in each of the categories as well.<\/p>\n<p>In tech, it has its Kindles and Fire tablets, Fire TV, and of course its huge hit Alexa-powered Echo devices, among many other products. Apparel is being pushed heavily in the company&#8217;s private-label efforts. Amazon just the other week announced that it was acquiring online drug seller PillPack for $1 billion, which will be a major lever in its wider health products and services strategy. And lastly, there is Amazon&#8217;s acquisition of Whole Foods and its much wider play around meal kits and its server-free physical shops. The physical aspect, eMarketer believes, will play a strong role in Amazon&#8217;s growth in this category.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAmazon\u2019s strategy for food and beverage is no different, in some respects, than it was for books\u2014dominate the category,\u201d eMarketer senior analyst Patricia Orsini notes in the report. \u201cHowever, e-commerce in the grocery sector is a challenge. Share of online sales in this category is low because most people, for a host of reasons, prefer to buy food in brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon has an advantage because its shopper base is comfortable with shopping online. Along with insights gathered about Whole Foods shoppers, Amazon probably has the best chance of converting in-store grocery buyers to online grocery buyers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>All of these will not just boost Amazon&#8217;s own direct sales but help create an environment for people to come to Amazon to buy either these at price-busting rates, or other-brand alternatives.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"CToWUd a6T\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/ci6.googleusercontent.com\/proxy\/O0Qa10BEiSJFTprTb0QMxoc7Dh5m7WazqibPgNyiZdE76tWvOaRIxxvfk3eXYOiAtS0q8VrO5at6RJ_4IuBWAN_qnyumtzY4oRUXueEtt0iRhLi2E9DRKUmlc8yB-fX_g_xhrY10orQbiI0_YgjEBvxxSxw64fN6Unir9g7fGfcjYtcHsI-wNY4sRYjdESI2NzyQOILXUma3KtqoXoVAzcks9LAJ3E-bSLsU1WW5_zXXeveDf9A_aWG5bXNJLE8vzfVDSgVIumG4=s0-d-e1-ft#http:\/\/sentpressrelease.com\/pressrelease\/image\/258076\/ZU1hcmtldGVyX1VTX0FtYXpvbl9SZXRhaWxfRWNvbW1lcmNlX1NhbGVzX2Zvcl9TZWxlY3RfUHJvZHVjdF9DYXRlZ29yaWVzXzIwMTYtMjAxOV8yMzkyNDYuanBn\" width=\"450\" height=\"393\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So far, people think that it is unlikely that Amazon would stand an antitrust investigation because e-commerce is still a small part of all commerce (as evidenced by the five percent of all retail sales figure), and Amazon would argue that in the world of &#8220;omnicommerce&#8221; it&#8217;s still just a bit player.

make movies like <em>Tangled<\/em>, where hair is basically the main character. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.disneyresearch.com\/publication\/haircontrol-a-tracking-solution-for-directable-hair-simulation\/\">A new bit of research<\/a> from the company makes it easier for animators to have hair follow their artistic intent while also moving realistically.<\/p>\n<p>The problem Disney Research aimed to solve was a compromise that animators have had to make when making the hair on characters do what the scene requires. While the hair will ultimately be rendered in glorious high-definition and with detailed physics, it&#8217;s too computationally expensive to do that while composing the scene.<\/p>\n<p>Should a young warrior in her tent be wearing her hair up or down? Should it fly out when she turns her head quickly to draw attention to the movement, or stay weighed down so the audience isn&#8217;t distracted? Trying various combinations of these things can eat up hours of rendering time. So, like any smart artist, they rough it out first:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Artists typically resort to lower-resolution simulations, where iterations are faster and manual edits possible,&#8221; reads the paper describing the new system. &#8220;But unfortunately, the parameter values determined in this way can only serve as an initial guess for the full-resolution simulation, which often behaves very different from its coarse counterpart when the same parameters are used.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YMABKFttrgQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The solution proposed by the researchers is basically to use that &#8220;initial guess&#8221; to inform a high-resolution simulation of just a handful of hairs. These &#8220;guide&#8221; hairs act as feedback for the original simulation, bringing a much better idea of how the rest will act when fully rendered.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1673264\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"wp-image-1673264\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/hairtypes.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"473\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The guide hairs will cause hair to clump as in the upper right, while faded affinities or an outline-based guide (below, left and right) would allow for more natural motion if desired.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>And because there are only a couple of them, their finer simulated characteristics can be tweaked and re-tweaked with minimal time. So an artist can fine-tune a flick of the ponytail or a puff of air on the bangs to create the desired effect, and not have to trust to chance that it&#8217;ll look like that in the final product.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a trivial thing to engineer, of course, and much of the paper describes the schemes the team created to make sure that no weirdness occurs because of the interactions of the high-def and low-def hair systems.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s still very early: it isn&#8217;t meant to simulate more complex hair motions like twisting, and they want to add better ways of spreading out the affinity of the bulk hair with the special guide hairs (as seen at right). But no doubt there are animators out there who can&#8217;t wait to get their hands on this once it gets where it&#8217;s going.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Disney is unequivocally the world&#8217;s leader in 3D simulations of hair \u2014 something of a niche talent in a way, but useful if you make movies like Tangled, where hair is basically the main character.

The study collected information in two stages; first for several weeks before the renovation and the second for several weeks after.<\/p>\n<p>While the concept behind open office spaces is to drive informal interaction and collaboration among employees, the study found that for both groups of employees monitored (52 for one company and 100 for the other company) face-to-face interactions dropped, the number of emails sent increased between 20 and 50 percent and company executives reported a qualitative drop in productivity.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[Organizations] transform their office architectures into open spaces with the intention of creating more [face-to-face] interaction and thus a more vibrant work environment,&#8221; the study&#8217;s authors, Ethan Bernstein and Stephen Turban, wrote. &#8220;[But] what they often get\u2014as captured by a steady stream of news articles professing the death of the open office is an open expanse of proximal employees choosing to isolate themselves as best they can (e.g. by wearing large headphones) while appearing to be as busy as possible (since everyone can see them).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While this study <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2011\/07\/who-moved-my-cube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is far from the first to point fingers<\/a> at open office space designs, the researchers claim this is the first study of its kind to collect qualitative data on this shift in working environment instead of relying primarily on employee surveys.<\/p>\n<p>From their results, the researchers provide three cautionary tales:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open office spaces don&#8217;t actually promote interaction. Instead, they cause employees to seek privacy wherever they can find it.<\/li>\n<li>These open spaces might spell bad news for collective company intelligence or, in other words, an overstimulating office space creates a decrease in organizational productivity.<\/li>\n<li>Not all channels of interaction will be effected equally in an open layout change. While the number of emails sent in the study did increase, the study found that the richness of this interaction was not equal to that lost in face-to-face interactions.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Seems like it might be time to (first, find a quiet room) and go back to the drawing board with the open office design.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;re endlessly distracted by your co-workers in the gaping open office space you all share, you&#8217;re not alone.

Turns out those right hands were here in front of our face all along.You probably know Anthony Ha from such websites as TechCrunch.com and conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt. I know him from sitting right next to me in TechCrunch\u2019s New York City headquarters.What you may not know, however, is that Anthony is a loud typist. Like ridiculously so. If the computer keyboard was an instrument, Anthony would be Glenn Gould. But, like, young Glenn Gould, not end-of-life, the weight of the world is on my shoulders Glenn Gould. He makes the computer keys sing.Naturally, he was the first person myself and the rest of the TechCrunch staff thought of when we heard about the updated keyboard. \u201cI\u2019ll type on any keyboard you put under me.\u201d Challenge accepted.Here are the results:https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RMyJlJV7XdIObservations:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Anthony is capable of making any keyboard loud. It\u2019s like the least helpful mutant ability, but there you go.<\/li>\n<li>This isn\u2019t scientific. Sadly TechCrunch\u2019s multi-million dollar keyboard sound recording laboratory was not finished in time for this piece. Rather I held my podcasting mic close next to the keys while Anthony typed.<\/li>\n<li>The sentence being typed is \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\u201d over and over again. It\u2019s like a more adorable version of that one scene from <em>The Shining<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>The difference is noticeable, but it\u2019s not like night and day or anything. As the company noted, the underlying technology is still the same here. They won\u2019t say precisely what\u2019s been tweaked, but it should be clear once the inevitable teardowns start popping up.<\/li>\n<li>There\u2019s a distinct difference in sound quality here. The original has a more clacking typewriter sound, while the new version is a bit more muffled \u2014 almost under water. The different quality could account for the perceived difference between the two.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s very nice outside today, but we\u2019re in here recording keyboard sounds.

It&#8217;s only natural: their constituencies will hear that Russians are using bitcoin to hack the election systems and take it at face value. They have to say <em>something<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>But this knee-jerk criticism is misguided and hypocritical for several reasons.<\/p>\n<p>First is that it&#8217;s not as anonymous and mysterious as critics make out. The details in the indictment actually provide an interesting example (far from the first) of the limits of cryptocurrency&#8217;s ability to obscure its users&#8217; activities.<\/p>\n<p>The painstaking research of the special investigator&#8217;s team revealed the approximate amounts and methods involved, and although there is a veneer of anonymity in that addresses are not inherently tied to identities, it is far from impossible to establish ownership. Not that they didn&#8217;t try, as the indictment shows:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Defendants conspired to launder the equivalent of more than $95,000 through a web of transactions structured to capitalize on the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>They also enlisted the assistance of one or more third-party exchangers who facilitated layers transactions through digital currency exchange platforms providing heightened anonymity.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But the process of laundering, after all, becomes rather difficult when there is an immutable, peer-maintained record of every penny being pushed around. Small slip-ups in the team&#8217;s operational security allowed investigators to tie, for example, an email address used to access a given bitcoin wallet with the one used to pay for a VPN.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>[U]sing funds in a bitcoin address, the Conspirators purchased a VPN account, which they later used to log into the @Guccifer_2 Twitter account. The remaining funds from that bitcoin address were then used [&#8230;] to lease a Malaysian server that hosted the dcleaks.com website.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s likely that the very same distributed ledger technology that allows for anonymous international payments in the first place also creates an invaluable investigative tool for those savvy enough to take advantage of it. So although bitcoin has its shady side, it&#8217;s far from perfect secrecy, especially when exposed to the privileges of a federal investigative team.<\/p>\n<p>The second reason the criticism will be hollow is that it doesn&#8217;t provide much in the way of new capabilities for those who wish to keep secret their activities online.<\/p>\n<p>There are established methods used by nation-states and garden-variety hackers and criminals alike that minimize or eliminate the possibility of tracking. Money laundering is performed at huge volumes worldwide and there are shady banks, loopholes and puppet organizations peppered across the globe.<\/p>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies are convenient for paying for things online because there are a number of vendors (dwindling, but they exist) that accept it straight, or if one is not available it is reasonably liquid and can be shifted easily. I feel sure that our own intelligence services are making good use of it.<\/p>\n<p>On that note is the third reason this FUD will be risible: If we are going to address the problem of dark money influencing politics, using bitcoin for hacking activities doesn&#8217;t even amount to a rounding error and it is cynical prestidigitation that makes it appear more than such.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t belabor the point, because it is surely topmost in many an American&#8217;s mind that cash funneled through Super PACs and offshore accounts, backroom deals and stock trades, favors for lobbyists and corporate &#8220;donators&#8221; and 20 other forms of pay-for-play in Washington are more of a clear and present danger than a handful of Russian operatives ineffectually obscuring peanuts payments for hosting fees and bribes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"st\">Perhaps the administration would prefer scripture: &#8220;Why do you see the speck that is in your brother&#8217;s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If anything these indictments are evidence only that cryptocurrency is here to stay, usable by you, or me, or an rival nation-state, or our own \u2014 just like any other financial instrument.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The indictment filed today against 12 Russians accused of, among other things, hacking the DNC and undermining Hillary Clinton&#8217;s campaign also notes that the alleged hackers paid for their nefarious deeds with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The histogram is nice to have and utilizes that iPhone notch well. The app doesn\u2019t have portrait mode, however, which Jackie and I would have loved, because, who doesn\u2019t love that buttery (fake) bokeh &#8212; amirite? Manipulating the exposure in video mode was equally as easy. The app didn\u2019t have an audio meter or level settings, so folks recording dialog or VO need to plan accordingly. Luckily, our shoot didn\u2019t need it since we were shooting slow-mo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/D78nf_uxEJA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a couple extra bucks you can get the same manual controls, audio levels, + RAW with ProCam 5.

facial recognition technology becomes pervasive, Microsoft (yes, Microsoft) issues a call for regulation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Technology companies have a privacy problem. They&#8217;re terribly good at invading ours and terribly negligent at protecting their own.<\/p>\n<p>And with the push by technologists to map, identify and index our physical as well as virtual presence with biometrics like face and fingerprint scanning, the increasing digital surveillance of our physical world is causing some of the companies that stand to benefit the most to call out to government to provide some guidelines on how they can use the incredibly powerful tools they&#8217;ve created.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what&#8217;s behind<a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.microsoft.com\/on-the-issues\/2018\/07\/13\/facial-recognition-technology-the-need-for-public-regulation-and-corporate-responsibility\/\"> today&#8217;s call from Microsoft President Brad Smith<\/a> for government to start thinking about how to oversee the facial recognition technology that&#8217;s now at the disposal of companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/microsoft\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Google, Apple and government security and surveillance services across the country and around the world.<\/p>\n<p>In what companies have framed as a quest to create &#8220;better,&#8221; more efficient and more targeted services for consumers, they have tried to solve the problem of user access by moving to increasingly passive (for the user) and intrusive (by the company) forms of identification &#8212; culminating in features like Apple&#8217;s Face ID and the frivolous filters that Snap overlays over users&#8217; selfies.<\/p>\n<p>Those same technologies are also being used by security and police forces in ways that have gotten technology companies into trouble with consumers or their own staff. Amazon has been called to task for its work with law enforcement, Microsoft&#8217;s own technologies have been used to help identify immigrants at the border (indirectly aiding in the separation of families and the virtual and physical lockdown of America against most forms of immigration) and Google faced an internal company revolt over the facial recognition work it was doing for the Pentagon.<\/p>\n<p>Smith posits this nightmare scenario:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine a government tracking everywhere you walked over the past month without your permission or knowledge. Imagine a database of everyone who attended a political rally that constitutes the very essence of free speech. Imagine the stores of a shopping mall using facial recognition to share information with each other about each shelf that you browse and product you buy, without asking you first. This has long been the stuff of science fiction and popular movies \u2013 like \u201cMinority Report,\u201d \u201cEnemy of the State\u201d and even \u201c1984\u201d \u2013 but now it\u2019s on the verge of becoming possible.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What&#8217;s impressive about this is the intimation that it isn&#8217;t already happening (and that Microsoft isn&#8217;t enabling it). Across the world, governments are deploying these tools right now as ways to control their populations (the ubiquitous surveillance state that China has assembled, and is investing billions of dollars to upgrade, is just the most obvious example).<\/p>\n<p>In this moment when corporate innovation and state power are merging in ways that consumers are only just beginning to fathom, executives who have to answer to a buying public are now pleading for government to set up some rails. Late capitalism is weird.<\/p>\n<p>But Smith&#8217;s advice is prescient. Companies do need to get ahead of the havoc their innovations can wreak on the world, and they can look good while doing nothing by hiding their own abdication of responsibility on the issue behind the government&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-1655267 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/GettyImages-495592910.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1732\" height=\"1732\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In a democratic republic, there is no substitute for decision making by our elected representatives regarding the issues that require the balancing of public safety with the essence of our democratic freedoms. Facial recognition will require the public and private sectors alike to step up \u2013 and to act,&#8221; Smith writes.<\/p>\n<p>The fact is, something does, indeed, need to be done.<\/p>\n<p>As Smith writes, &#8220;The more powerful the tool, the greater the benefit or damage it can cause. The last few months have brought this into stark relief when it comes to computer-assisted facial recognition \u2013 the ability of a computer to recognize people\u2019s faces from a photo or through a camera. This technology can catalog your photos, help reunite families or potentially be misused and abused by private companies and public authorities alike.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>All of this takes on faith that the technology actually works as advertised. And the problem is, right now, it doesn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/25\/facial-recognition-software-is-not-ready-for-use-by-law-enforcement\/\">In an op-ed earlier this month<\/a>, Brian Brackeen, the chief executive of a startup working on facial recognition technologies, pulled back the curtains on the industry&#8217;s not-so-secret huge problem.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Facial recognition technologies, used in the identification of suspects, negatively affects people of color. To deny this fact would be a lie.<\/p>\n<p>And clearly, facial recognition-powered government surveillance is an extraordinary invasion of the privacy of all citizens \u2014 and a slippery slope to losing control of our identities altogether.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s really no \u201cnice\u201d way to acknowledge these things.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Smith, himself admits that the technology has a long way to go before it&#8217;s perfect. But the implications of applying imperfect technologies are vast &#8212; and in the case of law enforcement, not academic. Designating an innocent bystander or civilian as a criminal suspect influences how police approach an individual.<\/p>\n<p>Those instances, even if they amount to only a handful, would lead me to argue that these technologies have no business being deployed in security situations.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1375483\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/surveillance-block.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As Smith himself notes, &#8220;Even if biases are addressed and facial recognition systems operate in a manner deemed fair for all people, we will still face challenges with potential failures. Facial recognition, like many AI technologies, typically have some rate of error even when they operate in an unbiased way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While Smith lays out the problem effectively, he&#8217;s less clear on the solution. He&#8217;s called for a government &#8220;expert commission&#8221; to be empaneled as a first step on the road to eventual federal regulation.<\/p>\n<p>That we&#8217;ve gotten here is an indication of how bad things actually are. It&#8217;s rare that a tech company has pleaded so nakedly for government intervention into an aspect of its business.<\/p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s Smith writing, &#8220;We live in a nation of laws, and the government needs to play an important role in regulating facial recognition technology. As a general principle, it seems more sensible to ask an elected government to regulate companies than to ask unelected companies to regulate such a government.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Given the current state of affairs in Washington, Smith may be asking too much. Which is why perhaps the most interesting &#8212; and admirable &#8212; call from Smith in his post is for technology companies to slow their roll.<\/p>\n<p><i>&#8220;<\/i>We recognize the importance of going more slowly when it comes to the deployment of the full range of facial recognition technology,&#8221; writes Smith. &#8220;Many information technologies, unlike something like pharmaceutical products, are distributed quickly and broadly to accelerate the pace of innovation and usage. &#8216;Move fast and break things&#8217; became something of a mantra in Silicon Valley earlier this decade. But if we move too fast with facial recognition, we may find that people\u2019s fundamental rights are being broken.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Technology companies have a privacy problem.

the researchers at <a href=\"http:\/\/emarketer.com\">eMarketer<\/a> could prove to be a fan to the flames.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon is set to clear $258.22 billion in US retail sales in 2018, according to eMarketer&#8217;s figures, which will work out to 49.1 percent of <em>all<\/em> online retail spend in the country, and 5 percent of all retail sales.<\/p>\n<p>It started as an online bookstore, but today Amazon is a behemoth in all areas of e-commerce, fuelled by a strong Marketplace network of third-party sellers, an ever-expanding range of goods from groceries to fashion, and a very popular loyalty program in the form of Prime.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it is fast approaching a tipping point where more people will be spending money online with Amazon, than with all other retailers &#8212; combined. Amazon&#8217;s next-closest competitor, eBay, a very, very distant second at 6.6 percent, and Apple in third at 3.9 percent. Walmart, the world&#8217;s biggest retailer when counting physical stores, has yet to really hit the right note in e-commerce and comes in behind Apple with 3.7 percent of online sales in the US.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical CToWUd a6T\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/ci4.googleusercontent.com\/proxy\/-PgHRaD0RNJP5Hhc5s3ahdXC9QvNKKslptI01GPA-NGOw4sezOr_irA70Eq8twzHdkDkuoXWxb7iF_IM4chlz6WyOsRdoSmIn-7giMfCCg5V0YM4M5uYX0I3uRL-McaPCeKkEun9WM5y6Q5-jGR1oj7bxPGvtrdSTjQES17D0L2GgWVqxGujhcvqcwIiKP8lvROjpn4kosty7oIKSDibR_emQsc22rDqo9PhojqcIFdBE3A2A0FHwofEi4cC=s0-d-e1-ft#http:\/\/sentpressrelease.com\/pressrelease\/image\/258076\/ZU1hcmtldGVyX1RvcF8xMF9VU19Db21wYW5pZXNfUmFua2VkX2J5X1JldGFpbF9FY29tbWVyY2VfU2FsZXNfU2hhcmVfMjAxOF8yMzk0NDcuanBn\" width=\"450\" height=\"617\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The figures &#8212; which eMarketer says are estimates &#8220;based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from research firms, government agencies, media firms and public companies, plus interviews with top executives at publishers, ad buyers and agencies&#8221; &#8212; are also remarkable not because of their size, but because of Amazon&#8217;s pace has not slowed down. Its sales are up 29.2 percent versus a year ago, when it commanded 43 percent of all e-commerce retail sales.<\/p>\n<p>The rocket ship for Amazon&#8217;s growth at the moment is its Marketplace &#8212; the platform where Amazon allows third-party sellers to use its retail and (if they choose) logistics infrastructure to sell and deliver items to Amazon shoppers. It&#8217;s currently accounting for 68 percent of all retail sales, working out to nearly $176 billion, versus 32 percent for Amazon&#8217;s direct sales, and eMarketer projects that by the end of this year, Marketplace&#8217;s share will be more than double that of Amazon&#8217;s own sales (it&#8217;s already about double).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that so many other online commerce businesses are chasing the marketplace model, which essentially creates transactions on two fronts for the platform operator, thereby improving margins that might be cut by not selling items directly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe continued growth of Amazon\u2019s Marketplace makes sense on a number of levels,\u201d eMarketer principal analyst Andrew Lipsman notes in the eMarketer report. \u201cMore buyers transacting more often on Amazon will naturally attract third-party sellers. But because third-party transactions are also more profitable, Amazon has every incentive to make the process as seamless as possible for those selling on the platform.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In terms of popular categories, consumer electronics and tech continue to be the leading product category: eMarketer projects sales of $65.82 billion, around one-fourth of all turnover.\u00a0Second will be apparel and accessories, which will pull in $39.88 billion of sales.\u00a0Third in 2018 are health, personal care and beauty with $16 billion. Fourth is food and beverage at a distant $4.75 billion.<\/p>\n<p>All of these are already up by 38 percent or more over a year ago (see the full table below), but what&#8217;s perhaps most notable is how Amazon has been investing in being a direct player in each of the categories as well.<\/p>\n<p>In tech, it has its Kindles and Fire tablets, Fire TV, and of course its huge hit Alexa-powered Echo devices, among many other products. Apparel is being pushed heavily in the company&#8217;s private-label efforts. Amazon just the other week announced that it was acquiring online drug seller PillPack for $1 billion, which will be a major lever in its wider health products and services strategy. And lastly, there is Amazon&#8217;s acquisition of Whole Foods and its much wider play around meal kits and its server-free physical shops. The physical aspect, eMarketer believes, will play a strong role in Amazon&#8217;s growth in this category.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAmazon\u2019s strategy for food and beverage is no different, in some respects, than it was for books\u2014dominate the category,\u201d eMarketer senior analyst Patricia Orsini notes in the report. \u201cHowever, e-commerce in the grocery sector is a challenge. Share of online sales in this category is low because most people, for a host of reasons, prefer to buy food in brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon has an advantage because its shopper base is comfortable with shopping online. Along with insights gathered about Whole Foods shoppers, Amazon probably has the best chance of converting in-store grocery buyers to online grocery buyers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>All of these will not just boost Amazon&#8217;s own direct sales but help create an environment for people to come to Amazon to buy either these at price-busting rates, or other-brand alternatives.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"CToWUd a6T\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/ci6.googleusercontent.com\/proxy\/O0Qa10BEiSJFTprTb0QMxoc7Dh5m7WazqibPgNyiZdE76tWvOaRIxxvfk3eXYOiAtS0q8VrO5at6RJ_4IuBWAN_qnyumtzY4oRUXueEtt0iRhLi2E9DRKUmlc8yB-fX_g_xhrY10orQbiI0_YgjEBvxxSxw64fN6Unir9g7fGfcjYtcHsI-wNY4sRYjdESI2NzyQOILXUma3KtqoXoVAzcks9LAJ3E-bSLsU1WW5_zXXeveDf9A_aWG5bXNJLE8vzfVDSgVIumG4=s0-d-e1-ft#http:\/\/sentpressrelease.com\/pressrelease\/image\/258076\/ZU1hcmtldGVyX1VTX0FtYXpvbl9SZXRhaWxfRWNvbW1lcmNlX1NhbGVzX2Zvcl9TZWxlY3RfUHJvZHVjdF9DYXRlZ29yaWVzXzIwMTYtMjAxOV8yMzkyNDYuanBn\" width=\"450\" height=\"393\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So far, people think that it is unlikely that Amazon would stand an antitrust investigation because e-commerce is still a small part of all commerce (as evidenced by the five percent of all retail sales figure), and Amazon would argue that in the world of &#8220;omnicommerce&#8221; it&#8217;s still just a bit player.

looks to help companies more easily find contractors in the area"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>For any company looking to spin up some kind of operation in a new region, one of the first steps may be finding contractors in the area that can actually get the work started \u2014 but, especially as companies drift farther from cities, that can increasingly become a nightmare that&#8217;s quite familiar to Matt Velker.<\/p>\n<p>That led to he and his co-founder Vignesh Venkataraman starting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emptor.ai\/home\">Emptor<\/a>, a network to connect companies with local contractors in order to get those local projects off the ground effectively. That can range from actual construction to janitorial work or landscaping. A platform like Emptor seeks to take a lot of the ambiguity or guesswork out of finding a set of local companies to work with in order to get construction projects off the ground. It also adds a robust audit trail \u2014 ratings or otherwise \u2014 to ensure that the best contractors surface and that everyone knows which ones they should skip. The company is coming out of Y Combinator.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Every time you&#8217;re building [projects in new regions you have to find an entirely new set of suppliers,&#8221; Velker said. &#8220;Often in rural areas when there isn&#8217;t a saturation of contractors like there is in a large metro, that discovery process within a reasonable time frame was the biggest challenge. Especially within the construction industry, there&#8217;s a huge deviation in terms of the quality of the companies you work with. We definitely had a lot of pains with unreliable contractors who weren&#8217;t getting the job done to spec or on time, or things that came close to fraud. It comes with the territory when you work with that volume of companies in a short period of time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1672688\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/PastedGraphic-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"587\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Companies first go to Emptor and describe the projects they want and what kinds of pricing structure they are offering. Then, kind of like Thumbtack or other marketplaces, Emptor matches those projects with qualified contractors and then compares those bids in order to select the best offer. It aims to be a replacement for the time spent searching around Yelp or Google, where there may be listings and pages but not a high volume of ratings \u2014 or ones that are even accurate to begin. Even after the search, getting the whole process started can take weeks, another period Emptor hopes to shrink by streamlining that process.<\/p>\n<p>Right now Emptor mainly focuses on facilities and maintenance, though should something like this take off it could add other elements of contract work that companies need. The approach also aims to be more granular, giving companies more ways to identify the needs of the project that might not necessarily just be quantitative. After all, better data about a company&#8217;s actual needs that flows into some algorithm can produce better matching, and that can also go down to the actual way compensation would work on that project.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Having just one number for what a project will cost is convenient from the supplier and buyer perspective, but it&#8217;s missing out on the ability to build structured data that you can analyze,&#8221; Velker said. &#8220;The companies are\u00a0deciding, &#8216;what do I need to know, how many years have you done in business.&#8217; You want to be explicit about how are we going to make this decision. If price is a factor, how much of a factor is it, so they can spec things out and there&#8217;s transparency to the buyers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But while it&#8217;s an attempt to try to bridge that gap between the company and a service provider, it&#8217;s one that many companies have tried to fill before. There are tools like Angie&#8217;s List and others for finding contractors, though Velker says those are primarily geared toward consumers \u2014 and some end up bending the apps in order to fill the needs they have for contractors without some kind of formal platform to use. Velker acknowledges the theory behind all these tools is pretty similar, though he hopes Emptor will be able to tackle the specific needs companies might have that he&#8217;s experienced himself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For any company looking to spin up some kind of operation in a new region, one of the first steps may be finding contractors in the area that can actually get the work started \u2014 but, especially as companies drift farther from cities, that can increasingly become a nightmare that&#8217;s quite familiar to Matt Velker.

Like many in the industry, he was drawn to venture capital for its forward-looking approach to business.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was an operator for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd as an operator, you focus on making the month, the quarter, the year. With venture, you\u2019re looking toward the horizon rather than the ground.\u201d\nThis perspective has proven fruitful. Jeremy has funded several companies that have since been acquired or gone public, most notably Snapchat, where he made the first investment. It\u2019s a track record that has landed him on the Forbes Midas List several times.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to completing an MBA at Stanford, Jeremy spent the \u201890s and early 2000s working for web pioneers such as Netscape, AOL, CitySearch, and Interactive Corp.

A lot of that is about keeping an open mind, about not rushing to judgment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>With Snapchat, for example, he recognized a fundamental shift that created opportunity for a disruptor. Conventional wisdom held that the post-Facebook social media landscape was too crowded to accommodate another platform. Yet Snapchat went on to shape popular culture. Why?<\/p>\n\n<p>Jeremy saw that users on Facebook and Instagram posted mostly highlight reels of their lives, leading to performance anxiety\u2014and less posting. Users worried, \u201cWill I get enough likes?\u201d Conversely, Snapchat\u2019s disappearing photos, and the absence of likes and follower counts, removed the perceived risk of posting a photo. People could be themselves.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cToday, people express themselves through Snapchat stories, gifs, and stickers,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore that, it was emojis and emoticons. Before that, it was their AIM Buddy icon or their ASCII signature on Usenet.

Her hope was to empower consumers with access to their own genetic information and to create a way to generate more personalized information so that commercial and academic researchers could better understand and develop new drugs and diagnostics. Presently, 23andMe has built one of the world\u2019s largest databases of individual genetic information. Its novel, web-based research approach allows for the rapid recruitment of participants to many genome-wide association studies at once, reducing the time and money needed to make new discoveries, and the company has created a proven and standardized resource for finding new genetic association and confirming genetic loci discovered by others. Under Anne\u2019s leadership 23andMe has made significant advances in bringing personalized medicine directly to the public. Anne graduated from Yale University with a BS in Biology. Getting access to and understanding her own genetic information had always been one of her ambitions.<\/p>","cbAvatar":"https:\/\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\/image\/upload\/v1501868404\/vqts9pro3z4bgtol8eri.png","company":"23andMe","featured":0,"name":"Anne Wojcicki","position":"Co-Founder & Chief Executive Officer","links":{"crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/anne-wojcicki","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/annewoj23","linkedin":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/annewojcicki"}},{"bio":"<p>Tony Xu is the CEO and co-founder of DoorDash, a technology company passionate about transforming local businesses and dedicated to enabling new ways of working, earning, and living.
